* New `shared` plan which allows Kafka producers or an orchestrator will create Kafka topics on demand. Unlike the `topic` plan, `shared` does not provide a pre-created Kafka topic, nor does the `uri` include a topic in the path. Please use the `topicNamePrefix` attribute as the prefix for all topic names. These topic names will be deleted by Deprovision (see below).
* Deprovision now deletes ALL topics that have the Service ID as a prefix. This means that you can use `topicName` as a prefix and dynamically create any number of topics that you need. Deprovision will clean them up with they are all named with `topicName` (the Service ID value) as the prefix.

  Remember, your Kafka `server.properties` needs to have `delete.topic.enable=true` configured to allow topics to be deleted. If `delete.topic.enable=false` then Deprovision will quietly ignore deleting topics and complete successfully.
* `bin/sanity-test` uses `eden` CLI to show catalog/provision/bind/unbind/deprovision against a service broker for both service plans
